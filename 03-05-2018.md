## Migrating your predefined configuration from .bash_profile to zsh

When you install zsh, it messes with your $PATH variable. Also, you might have some preconfigured stuff in your .bash_profile,
so it's a good idea to port it. Fairly straightforwad solution - just source your bash_profile in zshrc.

Add this line in ~/.zshrc
```
source ~/.bash_profile
```
